# _jqt_ Â· The _jq_ template engine

_jqt_ is a web template engine that uses [_jq_](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) as expression language.

If you want to learn to use _jqt_, read the documentation at
<https://fadado.github.io/jqt/>. The documentation is generated using _jqt_ in the `docs`
folder of this repository.

The tools used in the implementation of _jqt_ are:

* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
* [GPP](https://logological.org/gpp), a general-purpose preprocessor.
* [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), a universal document converter.
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), the classical tool for managing projects.
* [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) and other shell tools.

_jqt_ is developed under the _Fedora_ Linux distribution, and a lot of
portability issues are expected at this stage of development. Please, use this
GitHub repository features if you want to send any kind of questions.
